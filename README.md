# air-quality-regression
This code explores the dependence of Beijing air pollution quantity on month using a variety of regression models 
in scikit-learn (linear regression, polynomial regression, Support Vector Regression and Ensemble Regression).

To run the code, simply run the python script:

python air_quality_regression.py

The default regression model is polynomial regression. To change between different regression models, change the 
"method" option.

The air quality data is from:
